    "1. **Data Analysis Project:** Choose a dataset and perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.\n",
    "2. **Web Scraping and Data Visualization:** Use Beautiful Soup or Scrapy to scrape data from a website, and then visualize the data using Matplotlib or Seaborn.\n",
    "3. **Web Application:** Build a simple web application using Flask or FastAPI that displays data from a database dynamically.\n",
    "4. **Machine Learning Project:** Use Scikit-learn for a simple machine learning project, such as a classifier or regressor on a dataset of your choice.\n"
